The main files to be changed are as desired:
-ViewController.swift- this is the home page
-History.swift- the history page
-Quote.swift- the insporational quote page

Assets.xcassets is for adding files, which can be used for chanings the app's icon or adding images to be used in the app

LaunchScreen.storyboard is what shows initially when the app is opened, before everything is loaded. It is empty for now, but can be changed as desired

These files should be left alone:
-AppDelegate-
-Info.plist-

A .swfit viewcontroller or better, a link to a seaparate webpage, should be added when people of is created
